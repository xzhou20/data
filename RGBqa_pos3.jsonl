Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so.

However, by 2021, work had begun on a new AR headset, later reported to be codenamed Project Iris. After going through numerous iterations, Google unveiled a version of Iris at the 2022 Google I/O keynote before publicly testing prototype models later that year. The following year, Google was reported to have abandoned the project in the midst of company-wide layoffs and internal turmoil.  Google first experimented with the prospect of smartglasses with the introduction of Google Glass in 2013.[1] The product was panned by critics due to privacy and ethical concerns,[2] leading Google to discontinue the consumer-facing model and focus on the enterprise model."}]}

Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second.

Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show."}]}

Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world."}, {"title": "", "text": "The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (\u00a338.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government.

Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction.

View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele\u2019s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family\u2019s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying \u201cnope\u201d in his own way.

As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects. Yet Lucky, in partnership with OJ, gallops past a whole series of massive wind dolls dancing erratically, without batting an eye.

He wasn\u2019t even a Heisman finalist in 2022.\u00a0 That\u2019s because it\u2019s very difficult to win back-to-back Heisman Trophies. Heisman favorites and past winners alike enter fresh college football seasons with sky-high expectations, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to deliver.\u00a0 Anything less, and it feels like Heisman favorites (like Williams or Young) have underdelivered.\u00a0 Williams will likely be the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, following the same path as Young before him."}]}

But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box.

The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change.

The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case."}]}

It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing.

A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country is\u00a0a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation.

The news of Levi's return, specifically, came amid fan speculation that he would be cut from the franchise as the studio's newest CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran reconfigured the future of DC movies including Henry Cavill's departure as Superman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 3 being canceled.   In addition to concerns regarding the cast, backlash arose surrounding DC Studios' future storylines.

Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley."}]}

Although Bard hasn\u2019t officially replaced Google Assistant, it\u2019s a far more powerful AI assistant. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI \u201clearn\u201d natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public."}, {"title": "", "text": "which could help a range of Google products become more useful, but could also help other companies cut into Google\u2019s huge internet search business.

In late November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, an online chatbot that can answer questions, write term papers and riff on almost any topic. Two months later, the company\u2019s primary investor and partner, Microsoft, added a similar chatbot to its Bing internet search engine, showing how the technology could shift the market that Google has dominated for more than 20 years.

The change was made following renewed scrutiny of playoff overtime rules after the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 AFC divisional playoff win over the Buffalo Bills in January 2022. Prior to the possession rule change, 10 of the 11 playoff games that went to overtime under the post-2010 overtime rule changes were won by the team that received the ball first."}]}

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated."}, {"title": "", "text": "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen."}, {"title": "", "text": "The company markets the tool as a way to \u201cmake complex edits without pro-level editing tools,\u201d allowing you to leverage the power of AI to single out and transform a portion of your photo.

Google\u2019s Magic Editor attempts to package all the steps that it would take to make similar edits in a program like Photoshop into a single tap \u2014 or, at least, that\u2019s what it looks like from the demo. In Photoshop, for example, you\u2019re stuck using the Content-Aware Move tool (or any of the other methods of your choice) to pick up and move a subject inside of an image. Even then, the photo still might not look quite right, which means you\u2019ll have to pick up other tools, like the Clone Stamp tool or maybe even the Spot Healing Brush, to fix any leftover artifacts or a mismatched background. It\u2019s not the most complicated process ever, but as with most professional creative tools, there\u2019s a definite learning curve for people who are new to the program. I\u2019m all for Google making photo editing tools free and more accessible, given that Photoshop and some of the other image editing apps out there are expensive and pretty unintuitive.

Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.

Kate Ryder:\u00a0Thank you so much for having me. Thrilled to be here in Aspen. So I founded Maven in 2014 because I saw firsthand a lot of the gaps in the in the women\u2019s and family health care model. And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren\u2019t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we\u2019re also the richest country that spends the most on health care. And so you know, what Maven does is we really fill in all of these very distinct gaps through a virtual care and financial support platform.
