As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media.

RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession.

At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory.

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool."}, {"title": "", "text": "Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn\u2019t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU.

This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the \u201cResponsible Financial Innovation Act,\u201d was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022.

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are \u201cbridgeable differences\u201d between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, \u201cThis is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.\u201d Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. \u201cThe Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away."}, {"title": "", "text": "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,\u201d he shared.

While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn\u2019t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn\u2019t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. \u201cI think as an industry, it\u2019s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.\u201d Finally, it\u2019s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone\u2019s eye first was the opener of Apple\u2019s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone\u2019s recognizable screen cutout or \u2018notch\u2019 had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic \u2018island\u2019. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What\u2019s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first \u2014\u00a0and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well \u2014\u00a0the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul."}, {"title": "", "text": "The trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of \u2018sub-pixels\u2019 can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sensors look like this: Every \u2018pixel\u2019 essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally \u2018mosaicked\u2019 pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as \u2018Quad Bayer\u2019.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four \u2018super subpixels\u2019 of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image."}, {"title": "", "text": "Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations.

Let\u2019s check out everything there is to know about Overwatch 2 including its 5v5 switch, tank changes, maps, heroes & more. Overwatch has become one of the globe\u2019s most beloved FPS titles. Packed to the brim with awesome characters, beautiful maps, and accompanied by a vibrant esports scene, Blizzard\u2019s flagship FPS has cemented its place in gaming history. Therefore, when it was announced at Blizzcon 2019 that there was going to be a sequel, fans went wild. While it\u2019s been a long journey to the eventual release, pieces are finally starting to fall into place. From a release date to a look at the new heroes, here\u2019s everything we know about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the \u2018early access\u2019 label. Since the game\u2019s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event. Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled."}, {"title": "", "text": "Overwatch 2.

{"question_id": "RGB_83", "question": "Who won the 2022 Tour de France?", "answer": ["Jonas Vingegaard"], "context": [{"title": "", "text": "The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour\u2019s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium\u2019s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian\u2019s talents, so there\u2019s a good chance that he\u2019ll hold the Tour\u2019s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who\u2019s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour\u2019s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia\u2019s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour?

Maybe Rogli\u010d (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn\u2019t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June\u2019s Criterium du Dauphin\u00e9, the fact that he wasn\u2019t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team\u2019s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There\u2019s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today\u2019s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in S\u00f8nderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line.

Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday\u2019s 40km individual time trial, the Dane\u2019s lead is too much for Poga\u010dar to overcome. Poga\u010dar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour\u2019s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour\u2019s better time trialists, and there\u2019s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour\u2019s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour\u2019s King of Mountains competition. He won\u2019t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he\u2019s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins.

I thought Walter Cronkite and the news were so boring. But my dad insisted it was important to know what was going on in the world. My dad had no idea how he was preparing me. Night after night, Walter Cronkite came into the living room reporting the news, and people trusted that he was giving them the truth. My dad was one of those people.

Let\u2019s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn\u2019t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it\u2019ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it\u2019s a safe bet that Google will follow suit. That means we can expect the Pixel Watch 2 to arrive in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, barring any delays.  Pricing is more of an unknown. You could pick up a Pixel Watch for \u00a3339/$350 at launch, but prices quickly dropped and now you can get one for \u00a3300/$300 with a bit of shopping around. Would a successor land at a more modest price to drum up interest?

As such, it\u2019s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit\u2019s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features.

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) \u2014 A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation\u2019s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party\u2019s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party\u2019s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan\u2019s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan\u2019s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan\u2019s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor \u2014 which was made without parliamentary debate or approval \u2014 as well as the funeral\u2019s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe\u2019s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes.

Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in the United Kingdom."}]}

Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary."}, {"title": "", "text": "Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series\u2014including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation.

But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10.

That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal."}, {"title": "", "text": "Media Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J.

ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert.

The new movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale. Here\u2019s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad,\u00a0who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman\u2019s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.

Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.  \u00a0 How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge."}]}

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1\u00a0billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16\u00a0billion globally in 2011."}, {"title": "", "text": "Mr Roy says that Apple's decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It's not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India.

Sign up\u00a0for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders. Ryder has said in the past that her determination to create Maven\u00a0came partially as a result of her own medical frustration and trauma. A miscarriage left her feeling \"lost, discouraged, and confused why something so painful and physically taxing was considered outside the bounds of traditional healthcare,\" she wrote in a blog post. With the new funding, Ryder said the company needs to be careful about how it scales, but will not be conservative with the cash despite the current economic environment given the need to invest in growth opportunities. \"We're not putting this capital aside for a rainy day,\" she wrote on Monday. Global family benefits growth and Medicaid are two areas that Maven is prioritizing with the new funding. The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform. Additional Medicaid expansion requires \"a more localized approach, which must be more deliberate,\" Ryder said, \"but particularly in the aftermath of Roe, the need has never been greater.\" The Maven CEO laid out some more of her strategic thinking after the fundraise in a series of Twitter posts.
