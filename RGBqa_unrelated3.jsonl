Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women\u2019s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka\u2019s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka\u2019s career \u2014 a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.

Despite numerous coping conceptualization proposals, there is no agreement as to the core coping categories. This article presents the Coping Circumplex Model (CCM), which is designed to integrate various coping distinctions, drawing inspiration from the tradition of circumplex models in psychology. The model is based on the assumption that individuals in stressful situations face two tasks: they need to solve the problem and regulate their emotions, which are reflected in two corresponding dimensions, that is, the problem coping dimension and emotion coping dimension.

The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone. Apple is expected to offer a more affordable model and a follow up to the higher-end and more expensive first-generation model. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \"contact lenses\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s."}, {"title": "", "text": "ESPN2.

As such, it\u2019s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot.

Google is going the Apple route with proprietary straps. It will eventually open up to third-party manufacturers, but for now, you have to get your watch strap from Google. While your default option is a sweat-resistant Active band (which comes in large and small sizes), there are several other options, from a woven yarn strap to a leather band. Metal mesh and metal link bands are launching next spring. Google's reason for launching with a proprietary strap system is that it didn't want to disrupt the watch's circular case by introducing the lugs needed to fasten a traditional watch strap. It decided the best approach to preserve the watch's look was to design a strap system that attached to the top and bottom of the case using internal mechanisms. I watched Waraich snap the strap on and off and it looked simple, but it's still a shame you're limited to Google's initial selection of straps. (Remember Mode?) Curiously, some of Google's strap options do have metal fasteners that nestle next to the case, where they approximate lugs.

To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923.

He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan\u2019s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe\u2019s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted."}]}

The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020.

Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory.

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series.

However, if Google could improve anything with the design here, it should start with thinner bezels on the round display.

The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (\u201cThe Whale\u201d), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio,\u201d which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d; \u201cNavalny,\u201d which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E.

Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries."}]}

In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds.

The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[30]  The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[6]  The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps.[6]  The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13.

Emmert and the NCAA's Board of Governors announced Tuesday that he will be stepping down from his role as president by June 2023, or sooner if his replacement is found before then. Emmert, 69, has spent the entirety of his career in higher education and oversaw a period of dramatic change for college sports during his time with the NCAA. Revenue for the national office and the country's most powerful athletic departments exploded during Emmert's decade in charge. At a far slower pace, the foundational principle of amateurism shrank, eroded largely by legal battles and changing public sentiment. The power of his position seemingly eroded as well during a tenure that ended with criticism for the national office's inability to modernize its outdated rules and its inability to effectively enforce the rules it did have. The degree to which Emmert himself is responsible for any of these changes is open to debate, but the bigger questions about Emmert's time in charge of college sports are about the future. In what shape did he leave the office he's now vacating? And what type of organization will his replacement be asked to lead? NCAA board members are now faced with the unenviable task of conducting a job search without much of a job description to share with their candidates."}]}

Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. \"I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,\" she recalled later.

The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team\u2019s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008.

If big wins are what build confidence ahead of chasing trophies, then Arsenal and Barcelona got a big boost. Here's what you missed this weekend. Another weekend of European football is in the books and, once again, there is drama everywhere you look. It's ESPN's Weekend Review. Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez says Gavi's \"heart and soul\" is contagious for the rest of the team after a 3-1 win over Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti denied that Real Madrid's 3-1 loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Supercopa final was a \"sporting humiliation\" on Sunday. Gavi ran circles around Real Madrid in the Supercopa and the teenager helped coach Xavi Hernandez win his first trophy since taking over. Barcelona were crowned Spanish Super Cup champions after goals from Gavi, Robert Lewandowski and Pedri earned them a 3-1 win over Real Madrid. Karim Benzema refused to discuss the \"difficult\" events that saw him withdrawn from France's World Cup squad."}, {"title": "", "text": "A terrific choice for the subject of a biopic, with a story as strong as his, Sweetwater looks unmissable for any fans of basketball and beyond. Of course, any great biopic must have a strong lead, and also a strong ensemble cast to hold the movie together. Starring as Nat Clifton in this film is Everett Osborne (Chicago Fire), a terrific casting choice due to him being a former professional basketball player himself. Joining Osborne on screen are the likes of Cary Elwes (Saw) as Ned Irish, Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight) as Judd, Richard Dreyfuss (Jaws) as Maurice Podoloff, Jeremy Piven (Entourage) as Joe Lapchick, and Robert Ri'chard (Coach Carter). Also appearing are former Harlem Globetrotter Kevin Daley, blues musician Gary Clark Jr., and Milwaukee Bucks power forward and center Bobby Portis, alongside Jim Meskimen (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) With a strong cast list and a tale that will resonate thematically due to its subject relevance and truthful nature, Sweetwater looks like one of the best sports biopics to take to our screens in 2023."}, {"title": "", "text": "The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage is an international award established in 2010 by the Georgia Institute of Technology in recognition of the late\u00a0..."}]}
